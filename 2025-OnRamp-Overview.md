# OnRamp 2025 Overview

The DevOps Collective's OnRamp program returns for another year with a revamped focus and direction.
This one-of-a-kind initiative is designed for emerging IT professionals eager to accelerate their
careers in automation, DevOps, and cloud technologies. Participants gain valuable insights into the
modern IT landscape and what a successful IT career looks like today. The program combines
expert-led presentations and hands-on demonstrations, providing attendees with a well-rounded
learning experience.

OnRamp attendees experience a curated mix of content from both the OnRamp program and select
sessions from the PowerShell Summit conference main track. Please note that attendees must adhere to
their designated event based on their ticket. Due to the structure of the OnRamp agenda, switching
between events isn't permitted.

## Agenda

- An introduction to cloud technologies
- Containers and Kubernetes
