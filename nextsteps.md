# Next steps

![ms powershell](images/PowerShell-transparent-thumb.jpg)

Thank you for attending this year's event. We hope it was a valuable experience for you. It
certainly was for us. You always learn something new, even from those who think they have nothing to
share.

As we wrap up, here are some next steps for you:

1. **Apply what you've learned**: Take the knowledge you've gained and apply it to your career.
1. **Share your knowledge**: Share what you've learned with others. Even something as simple as
   showing a co-worker how to use a command makes a difference. There's always someone who knows
   less than you.
1. **Continue learning**: Much of the OnRamp agenda introduced you to new topics and technologies.
   Choose one that excites you or helps with your work, and dive deeper.
1. **Engage with the PowerShell community**: We've discussed this a lot this week. If you have
   questions, feel free to message us on Slack or use the [discussion section][discussions] in the
   OnRamp 2025 GitHub repository.

## Books

To deepen your PowerShell knowledge, consider the following books:

1. [Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches][powershell-month-lunches]
1. [Learn PowerShell Scripting in a Month of Lunches][scripting-month-lunches]
1. [The PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking Book][scripting-toolmaking]

If you're unsure where to start, [The PowerShell Practice Primer][psprimer] by Jeff Hicks is a great
choice. It's filled with exercises and challenges designed to help you learn by doing. Note: The
exercises are written for Windows PowerShell 5.1, but most work in PowerShell 7 on Windows, though
some solutions might vary.

If you're focused on Windows PowerShell, consider
[[PowerShell 101 - The No-Nonsense Guide to Windows PowerShell][powershell101]].

## Videos

- Subscribe to the [PowerShell.org YouTube channel][youtube] for recordings of past events,
  including this year's sessions when they're released.
- For more structured learning, check out Pluralsight, where Jeff Hicks has several PowerShell
  courses. You can find his courses [here][pluralsight].
- Additional courses are available on [LinkedIn Learning][linkedin-learning] and
  [Udemy][udemy].

We also recommend asking peers about their favorite learning resources. The more content you consume
from different creators, the better you reinforce your understanding. But remember: the best way to
learn is by doing.

Thank you for trusting us with your time this week. We hope it was a valuable investment.
