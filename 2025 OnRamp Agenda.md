# OnRamp 2025 agenda

<img align="right" src="images/PowerShell-transparent-thumb.jpg" alt="PowerShell hero image." >

Welcome to **OnRamp 2024**! This week is all about jump-starting your IT career. Our organizers have
put together an incredible program featuring a mix of presentations, demonstrations, and discussions
led by seasoned IT professionals.

As a _conference-within-a-conference_, OnRamp gives you exclusive content while integrating key
sessions from the main PowerShell Summit conference. Your schedule includes attendance to keynotes,
major events, and evening social events — a perfect opportunity to connect with industry
professionals and peers. Networking breaks are aligned with the main conference to maximize your
experience.

## What to expect

Participation in all OnRamp sessions is required. Attendees must remain within the OnRamp program
and are **not** permitted to switch between OnRamp and main conference sessions.

### Course materials

We use the _OnRamp_ Slack channel for communications. Have a question? Don't hesitate to ask. If you
prefer, use this channel for follow-ups or comments after the day's sessions. The main conference
Slack channels are also great ways to network with other attendees.

Presentation slides, sample code, and other materials will be available on GitHub:

➡️ [OnRamp 2025 GitHub repository][onramp-2025].

You can download a ZIP file of all materials without needing a GitHub account. Content is updated
throughout the week, and the final version will be available within a week of the program's
conclusion.

## Agenda

This year's OnRamp agenda features a mix of live presentations, interactive sessions, and open
discussions. Breaks coincide with the main tracks for networking opportunities. The schedule is
always subject to change.
